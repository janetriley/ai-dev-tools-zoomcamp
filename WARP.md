# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal learning repository for the DataTalks.Club 2025 AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp course. The repository is organized into module directories (`module_1/`, `module_2/`, etc.) corresponding to course modules.

## Repository Structure

```

├── module_1/          # Course Module 1 materials and exercises
├── module_2/          # Course Module 2 materials and exercises
├── module_3/          # Course Module 3 materials and exercises
├── module_4/          # Course Module 4 materials and exercises

## Module Organization

Each module directory is intended to contain:
- Exercise files and solutions
- Homework assignments
- Notes and experiments
- Any supporting code or data

When creating files for a specific module, place them in the appropriate `module_*/` directory.

## Python Development

### Python Version

- Primary Python version: Python 3.12+
- Use `python3.12` command for consistency

### Environment Setup

The repository uses Python with standard gitignore patterns for:
- Virtual environments (`.venv/`, `venv/`, etc.)
- Python caching (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`)
- Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb_checkpoints/`)
- Common Python tooling (`.ruff_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.pytest_cache/`)

When setting up Python environments for exercises:
- Create virtual environments within module directories if needed (`python3 -m venv .venv`)
- Check for `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` in each module
- Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- The `.gitignore` excludes common virtual environment directory names


## Working with Course Materials

### Course Repository Reference

There is a read-only local copy of the course repo at `/Users/me/workspace/ai_dev_tools/main_course_repo`.
- **Do not modify** any files in this directory
- Update command: `cd /Users/me/workspace/ai_dev_tools/main_course_repo; git pull; cd -;`

### Homework Workflow
My repository is at /Users/me/workspace/ai_dev_tools/my-ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp/ . All file changes should be made here. 

The homework module directories are named 01-overview, 02-end-to-end, 03-mcp, 04-build-coding-agent, 05-cicd-devops, 06-automation-lowcode . I will refer to these as $MODULE here. 

When working on homework or exercises:

1. **Update course materials**: At the start of each session, run `git pull` in `/Users/me/workspace/ai_dev_tools/main_course_repo` to get the latest materials

2. **Review official materials**: Check `/Users/me/workspace/ai_dev_tools/main_course_repo` for:
   - Homework instructions (usually markdown files)
   - Starter code (Python scripts, notebooks)
   - Sample data files
   - Module-specific requirements

3. **Copy to working directory**: Copy README.md files from the course repo into the matching `0*-*/` directory in my repository. Do not copy sample code.

4. **Read evaluation criteria**: Check the homework submission questions on https://courses.datatalks.club/ai-dev-tools-2025/ before starting work

5. **Organize by module**: Keep all work for a module in its `0%d-*/` directory:
   - `homework.md` for written homework answers
   - `notes.md` for personal notes and experiments
   - Supporting scripts and data files

6. Homework files will include code generated by agents and tools. Don't modify a code file without asking.

7. **Reference FAQ**: Check https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uBSxORcxOewXMzMDHwADpVSiS0kBRXhTQ3qWd86CjlI/ for common questions

### File Naming Conventions

- Homework submissions: `$MODULE/homework.md` or `$MODULE/homework.ipynb`
- Notes and experiments: `$MODULE/notes.md` or `$MODULE/experiments/`
- Modified starter code: Keep original names for clarity
